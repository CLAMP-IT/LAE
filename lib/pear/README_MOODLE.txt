These functions:
    _calculateSharedStringsSizes()
    _storeSharedStringsTable()
have been inserted, replacing the original functions in order to make the function
work with 2-byte data.  The patch is discussed at this URL:
    http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=1572
and documented for Moodle at:
    http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-9911

Such modifications should be carefuly each time the Excel PEAR package is updated
to a new release within Moodle.
