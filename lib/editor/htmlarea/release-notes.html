    <h2>Rationale for Beta</h2>

    <p>Why was this released as "Beta"?  The code is quite stable and it
    didn't deserve a "Beta" qualification.  However, there are some things
    left to do for the real 3.0 version.  These things will not affect the
    API to work with HTMLArea, in other words, you can install the Beta
    right now and then install the final release without modifying your
    code.  That's if you don't modify HTMLArea itself.  ;-)</p>

    <h2>To-Do before 3.0 final</h2>

    <ol>

      <li>We should use a single popup interface.  Currently there are two:
      dialog.js and popupwin.js; dialog.js emulates modal dialogs, which
      sucks when you want to open "select-color" from another popup and not
      from the editor itself.  Very buggy in IE.  We should probably use only
      modeless dialogs (that is, popupwin.js).</li>

      <li>Internationalization for the SpellChecker plugin.</li>

      <li>Internationalization for the TableOperations plugin.</li>

      <li>People who sent translations are invited to re-iterate through
        their work and make it up-to-date with lang/en.js which is the main
        lang file for HTMLArea-3.0.  Some things have changed but not all
        translations are updated.</li>

      <li><strong>Documentation</strong>.</li>

    </ol>
