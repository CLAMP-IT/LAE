/// MISSING WORD FORMAT

/// This Moodle class provides all functions necessary to import and export 
/// one-correct-answer multiple choice questions in this format:
///
///    As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
///    we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology 
///    ~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
/// 
/// Each answer is separated with a tilde ~, and the correct answer is 
/// prefixed with an equals sign =
///
/// Percentage weights can be included by following the tilde with the
/// desired percent.  Comments can be included for each choice by following
/// the comment with a hash mark ("#") and the comment.  Example:
///
///    This is {=the best answer#comment on the best answer ~75%a good
///    answer#comment on the good answer ~a wrong one#comment on the bad answer}
