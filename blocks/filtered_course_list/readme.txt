README for Simple File Upload

version: 1.0 2009-07-29

Installation: 

Unzip files into your Moodle blocks directory. This will create a folder called filtered_course_list. 

Go to the admin Notifications page to complete installation.


Configuration: 

To configure the block, go to Site Administration > Modules > Blocks > Current Courses List

On this page, you can choose to filter by Terms or by Categories. 

Choose "terms" if you organize courses by including a certain string within the course shortname (e.g. BIO101-01S09 = the S09 at the end indicates the term). 

Choose "categories" if you organize your courses into categories by term.  


Plans for Future Development: 

We will be adding the ability to choose multiple categories or substrings to be shown as "current" or "future" for both categories and terms.
