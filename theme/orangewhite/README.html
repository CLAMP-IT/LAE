<h3>Moodle Theme ORANGEWHITE</h3>

<p>A custom Moodle theme by <strong>Urs Hunkler, <a href="http://www.unodo.de" target="_blank">unodo</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The design approach of this theme is based on the known web page layout with navigation left and information right.</p>

<p>This theme is based on the standard theme layout. Actual changes in Moodle development concerning fonts and colors can lead to inconsistencies in the Moodle page appearance.</p>

<p>For Moodle 1.9 onwards, to use the orangewhite hide/show block icons (pix/t/switch_minus.gif, switch_plus.gif), admins need to enable Smart pix search (Site Administration - Miscellaneous - Experimental - smartpix).</p>
