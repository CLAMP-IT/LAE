<h1>Question categories</h1>

<p>Rather than keeping all your questions in one big list,
   you can create categories to keep them in.</p>

<p>Categories can be created or deleted at will. But :
<ul><li> There must be at least one category in each context. So you
cannot delete the last category in a context.</li>
<li>When you try to delete a category containing
   questions, then you will be asked to specify another
   category to move them to.</li></ul></p>

<p>You can arrange your categories in a hierarchy so
   that they are easier to manage. Editing categories is done under the 'Categories'
   tab in the question bank.</p>

   <ul><li>On the main page under the 'Categories' tab in the question bank :
   <ul><li>the up and down
   arrow keys change the order in
   which categories which are peers of each other are listed.</li>
   <li>Under the 'Categories' tab in the question bank, you can also move a category
   to a new context with the up / down arrows.</li>
   <li>The left and right arrows are used to
   change the parent category of a category.</li></ul></li>
   <li>A possibly quicker way to move categories is to click on the edit
   icon in the 'Categories' tab in the question bank and then use the category
        select box to select a new parent category.</li></ul></p>
