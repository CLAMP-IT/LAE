<h1>How to Search</h1>

<p>Full-text searching supports a number of options, listed below.  You can combine
   these to specify your search more precisely.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>search for these words</strong></td>
<td>For basic searching of one or more words anywhere in the texts, just type them separated by spaces. All words longer than two characters are used.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>+search +for these words</strong></td>
<td>The previous example would also match "information" because it contains "for". To force exact matching of a word, use the plus sign.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>+search -engine</strong></td>
<td>Use the minus sign if there are particular exact words you don't want included in the search.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>"search engine"</strong></td>
<td>To search for a particular phrase, use double quotes around it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>user:Kim</strong></td>
<td>To search for texts by a particular user, prefix a word from their name with "user:".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>userid:6</strong></td>
<td>If you know the user id of a particular user, you can search for them like this.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>subject:assessment</strong></td>
<td>To search for a word within the subject or title of a text only, prefix the word with "subject:".</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>For advanced searching, press the search button without typing anything in the words field - you will see
   a complete form that makes it easier to do advanced searches.</p>
