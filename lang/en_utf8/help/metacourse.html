<h1>Meta course</h1>

<p>A meta course takes enrolments (and other role assignments) from a "child" course or courses. In other words, for every child course added to the meta course, all students (and users in other roles) are also enrolled in the meta course.</p>

<p>Individual students cannot be added to a meta course, only child courses via the "Child courses" link in the course administration bock.</p>
