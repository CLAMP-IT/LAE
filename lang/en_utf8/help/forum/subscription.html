<h1>Forum Subscription</h1>

<p>When a person is subscribed to a forum it means that 
they will be sent email copies of every post in that forum
(posts are sent about <?php echo $CFG->maxeditingtime/60 ?> minutes 
after the post was first written).</p>

<p>People can usually choose whether or not they want to be 
subscribed to each forum.</p>

<p>However, if a teacher forces subscription on a particular forum 
then this choice is taken away and everyone in the class will get 
email copies.</p>

<p>This is especially useful in the News forum and in forums
towards the beginning of the course (before everyone has 
worked out that they can subscribe to these emails themselves).</p>
