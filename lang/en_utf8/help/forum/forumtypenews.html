<h1>News Forum</h1>

<p>The news forum is a special forum that is automatically created for 
each course and for the front page of the site and is a place for general 
announcements. You can only have one news forum per course.</p>

<p>The "Latest news" block will display recent discussions from this special 
forum (even if you rename it).  For this reason the forum will be automatically 
recreated by Moodle if you are using the LatestNews block.</p>
