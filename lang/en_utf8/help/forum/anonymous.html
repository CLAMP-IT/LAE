<h1>Anonymous Forums</h1>

<p>If anonymous posts for forums are enabled, users can
post messages in forums and discussions without revealing
their name to other users. All such posts will appear as by
an anonymous user.

The instructor can choose three different modes for this
setting. Note that the logs still report user activity so
this is not truly anonymous. 
</p>

<p>There are three choices for this setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never [default]: participants may not post anonymously.</li>
<li>Always: all posts are anonymous.</li>
<li>Sometimes: participants may choose to post anonymously.</li>
</ul>
