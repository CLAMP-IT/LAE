<h1>Language Editing</h1>

<p>To edit languages on this page the files need to be writable 
   by the web server process.</p>

<p>Within some of the strings you will notice <b>$a</b> and <b>$a->something</b>.</p>

<p>These represent variables that will be replaced by names or other words from 
   within Moodle.</p>  

<p>When there is only one variable, the $a form is used.  When there are two or 
   more variables, then each one has a name.</p>
