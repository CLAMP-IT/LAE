<h1>Course Categories</h1>

<p>Your Moodle administrator may have set up several 
   course categories.</p>

<p>For example, "Science", "Humanities", "Public Health" etc</p>

<p>Choose the one most applicable for your course.  This 
   choice will affect where your course is displayed on the 
   course listing and may make it easier for students to 
   find your course.</p>
