<h1>Scales</h1>

<p>Teachers can create new custom scales to be used in a course for any grading activities.</p>

<p>The name of the scale should be a phrase that identifies it clearly: this will appear
   in scale-selection lists, as well as on context-sensitive help buttons.</p>

<p>The scale itself is defined by an ordered list of values, ranging from negative to positive, separated by commas.  For example:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>
   Disappointing, Not good enough, Average, Good, Very good, Excellent!
</i></p>

<p>Scales should also include a good description of what it means and how it is
   expected to be used.  This description will appear in help pages for teachers and students.</p>

<p>Finally, there may be one or more "Standard" scales defined on your site by the 
   system administrator.  These will be available in all courses.</p>
