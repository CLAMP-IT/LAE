<h1>Quick Grade</h1>

<p>With quickgrading enabled you can quickly grade multiple assignments on one page.</p>

<p>Just change the grades and comments and use the Save button at the bottom to save 
   all your changes for that page at once.</p>

<p>The normal grading buttons on the right still work too in case you need more space.  
   Your quickgrading preference is saved and will apply to all assignments in all courses.</p>
