<h1>Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>

<p>This site has been tested in a range of browsers and with screen reader software.</p>

<p>Moodle uses semantic markup to assist screen reader users among others &mdash; site, page
 and block headings use &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, navigation blocks are lists &lt;ul&gt; and so on.
</p>

<p>Moodle complies with the World Wide Web Consortium's [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0">Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a>] level 1, most of level 2 
 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AA-Conformance"  title="About Double-A WCAG conformance">about Double-A conformance</a>] 
 and some level 3. Through these guidelines we aim to comply with local laws regarding access to those with disabilities. 
 We are currently working to improve the accessibility and usability of Moodle. 
 At present there are still some tables used for layout, but in general presentation (using style sheets) is separated from content.
</p>

<p>We welcome feedback, particularly reports of any inaccessible content. 
 Please [<a href="./message/discussion.php?id=2">message the administrator</a>].
</p>


<h2>Access keys</h2>

<p>At present we don't specify access keys, but we intend implementing them for a future release of Moodle.</p>


<h2>Links</h2>

<p>There is a link before each side block, which allows screen reader users to skip the block.
 Note, the link is hidden from graphical browsers.</p>

<p>Many links have title attributes 
that describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already 
fully describes the target (such as the headline of an article). If a link has 
an access key this will be announced in the link title.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, links are written to make sense out of context.
 There are no javascript: pseudo-links. </p>


<h2>Images</h2>

<p>All images use the alt attribute to 
provide alternate text where appropriate; images that are purely decorative 
contain a null alt attribute. Images, such as maps, that present complex 
information have a longdesc attribute linking them to a text description of the 
image content.</p>


<h2>Standards compliance</h2>

<p>This site is built using valid 
 <acronym title="Extensible Hyper-Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> 
 for markup and uses CSS for presentation.</p>
