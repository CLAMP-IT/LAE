<h1>Profile field visibility</h1>
<p>Each custom field can be given one of three visibility settings: invisible, everyone and user. The invisible setting would typically be set by an administrator who wants to hold private data on the users. The 'user' setting would normally be selected for a field that holds sensitive information, while the 'everyone' setting can be used for any type of information.</p>
