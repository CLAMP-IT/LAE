<h1>Default Role</h1>

<p>This role is what people get when no role is explicitly assigned,
   such as when people are self-enrolling in your course using a password.</p>

<p>It's also used as a default by enrolment plugins that may be enrolling 
   participants in this course based on data from other systems.</p>

<p>Most of the time this would be left to the Site Default setting so that
   the Site Administrator can decide the default role for all courses.</p>
