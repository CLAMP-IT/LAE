<h1>Switch roles</h1>

<p>This menu allows you to switch temporarily to another role so that you can see what the course would look like to someone with that role.</p>

<p>The roles available are the same as the roles that you are allowed to assign to people.</p>

<p>When you've finished navigating around the course you can return to your normal role using the button on the course page or the link at the top of any page.</p>
