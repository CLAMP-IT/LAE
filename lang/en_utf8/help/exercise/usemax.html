<h1>Handling of Multiple Submissions</h1>

<p>This option determines how the exercise should calculate the 
    final grades of the students. When there are multiple submissions 
    the teacher can chose between either using the best grade or the 
    mean grade from each students' set of submissions. This option 
    can be changed at any time during the exercise. Any change has an 
    immediate effect in the Grades page (provided, of course, multiple
    submissions are present).</p>
