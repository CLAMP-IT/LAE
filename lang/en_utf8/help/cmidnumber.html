<h1>ID number</h1>
<p>Setting an ID number provides a way of identifying the activity for grade calculation purposes. 
If the activity is not included in any grade calculation then the ID number field can be left blank.</p>
<p> The ID number can also be set on the edit grade calculation page in the gradebook, though it can 
only be edited on the update activity page.</p>
