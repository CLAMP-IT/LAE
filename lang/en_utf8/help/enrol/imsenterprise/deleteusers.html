<h1>Automatic deletion of user accounts</h1>

<p>IMS Enterprise enrolment data can specify the deletion of user accounts (if the "recstatus" flag is set to 3, which represents deletion of an account), if this setting is turned on.</p>

<p>As is standard in Moodle, the user record isn't actually deleted from Moodle's database, but a flag is set to mark the account as deleted.</p>
