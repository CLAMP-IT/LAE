<h1>Automatic creation of user accounts</h1>

<p>IMS Enterprise enrolment data typically describes a set of users. If this setting is turned on, accounts can be created for any users not found in Moodle's database.</p>

<p>Users are searched for first by their "idnumber", and second by their Moodle username.</p>

<h1>Passwords</h1>
<p>Passwords are not imported by the IMS Enterprise plugin. We recommend using Moodle's authentication plugins to authenticate users.</p>
