<h1>Shuffle the choices</h1>

<p>If you enable this option, then the order of choices within 
   each question will be randomly shuffled each time a student 
   attempts this quiz.</p>

<p>Of course, this only applies to questions that have multiple 
   options displayed, such as multiple choice or matching questions.</p>

<p>The intention is simply to make it a little harder for students 
   to copy from each other.</p>

<p>This option is not related to the use of Random Questions.</p>
