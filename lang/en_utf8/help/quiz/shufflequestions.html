<h1>Shuffle questions</h1>

<p>If you enable this option, then the order of questions in 
   the quiz will be randomly shuffled each time a student attempts
   the quiz.</p>

<p>This is not related to the use of Random Questions, this is only 
   about the displayed order of questions.</p>

<p>The intention is to make it a little harder for students to copy from
   each other.</p>
