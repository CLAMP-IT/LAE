<h1>Questions per page</h1>

<p>For longer quizzes it makes sense to stretch the quiz over several pages by limiting the number of questions per page. When adding questions to the quiz page breaks will automatically be inserted according to the setting you choose here. However you will also be able to move page breaks around by hand later on the editing page.
