<h1>Apply penalty</h1>

<p>If a quiz is run in adaptive mode then a student is allowed to try again after a wrong response. In this case you may want to impose a penalty for each wrong response to be subtracted from the final mark for the question. The amount of penalty is chosen individually for each question when setting up or editing the question.</p>

<p>This setting has no effect unless the quiz is run in adaptive mode.</p>
