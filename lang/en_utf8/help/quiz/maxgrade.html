<h1>Maximum grade</h1>

<p>The maximum grade you set for a quiz is what all grades 
   are scaled to.</p>

<p>For example, you might set the max grade to 20, because the
   quiz is worth 20% of the whole course.</p>

<p>Even though you might have 10 questions in your quiz 
   worth a total of 50 marks, all grades out of 50 will be 
   "scaled down" to the quiz max grade of 20.</p>
