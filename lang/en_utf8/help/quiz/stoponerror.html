<h1>Stop on error</h1>

<p>Questions are imported in two passes. First the
imput file is 'parsed' and checked for validity. Then
it is written to the database. If this option is
selected (default) and an error is detected in the
parsing pass then no attempt will be made to write
to the database.</p>

<p>If it is not checked, an attempt will be made to
write any valid questions to the database.</p>
