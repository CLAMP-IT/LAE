The Chat module allows participants to have a real-time synchronous 
discussion via the web.  This is a useful way to get a different 
understanding of each other and the topic being discussed - the mode
of using a chat room is quite different from the asynchronous forums. 
The Chat module contains a number of features for managing and 
reviewing chat discussions.
