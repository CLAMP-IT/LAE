<h1>Synchronise legacy grades</h1>

<p>The term 'legacy grades' refers to grades from versions of Moodle prior to 1.9. When upgrading, all legacy grades should be included in the Moodle 1.9 gradebook. The 'Synchronise legacy grades' button checks whether this is the case, and if necessary adds any missing legacy grades to the Moodle 1.9 gradebook.</p>
