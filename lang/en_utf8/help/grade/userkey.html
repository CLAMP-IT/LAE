<h1>User key</h1>
<p>Grade publishing is a way of exporting grades via a URL without being logged in to Moodle. A user key is a randomly generated series of characters which is appended to the URL for security purposes.</p>

<p>To publish grades, select "Create a new user key". When the form is submitted, a new user key is created. Alternatively, a key which was created previously may be selected.
