<h1>Initial Page Name for wiki</h1>
<p>
If you want the first wiki page name to be something other than the
wiki name, you can specify it here. This name will become the first 
page of the wiki for every created instance of this wiki.<br /><br />

If you leave this field blank, the initial page name will be the wiki name, unless you select
a page in the 'initial page' field.
