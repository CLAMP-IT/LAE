<h1>Allow Binary Files</h1>

<p>If you allow binary content (such as images), you have two possibilities:<br />
<ol>
  <li>You can upload and use images on wiki-pages. When editing a page, an upload form will be displayed 
      for uploading images. After a successful upload, an image code is displayed that you can embed in
      your pages using square brackets. For example: [internal://myimage.gif].</li>

  <li>You can attach files to a Wiki Page which can be displayed by the <i>attachments</i> action. 
      The size is limited to the setting made in Moodle.</li>
</ol>
