<h1>Wiki Usage</h1>

<p>
Wiki is a platform for working together on constructing web pages. The principles are simple.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A text is written and saved.</li>
<li>Later, another person may read that text and think of some additions or
    corrections that could be made. They choose "Edit" and make their changes to the page. </li>
<li>After saving their new version, it is available globally.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a wiki, it is also easily possible to add a page or link to existing pages.</p>


<ul>
<li>A link is created by a WikiWord. This is one word with at least two capital letters. If a page with this name already exist, it will be linked automatically, if not, it will be displayed with a question mark.</li>
<li>Clicking on this question mark, will start a new blank page with that name, ready to edit.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="center">Wiki formatting rules</h3>


<h4> Paragraphs</h4>
  <ul>
  <li> separate paragraphs inside the text with empty lines</li>
  <li> use three percent signs %%% to enforce a line break</li>
  <li> if you prepend text with spaces or tabs it will get indented  </li>
  </ul>

<h4> !! Headlines</h4>

  <ul type="circle">
  <li> use an exclamation mark ! at the beginning of a line to create a small headline</li>

  <li> !! for medium</li>
  <li> !!! for large headlines  </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Text style</h4>

  <ul>

  <li> if you want to <em>emphasize text</em> enclose it in two single-quotes '' (usually looks italic)</li>
  <li> <strong>text gets bold</strong> with two underscores __ (or if enclosed with two asterisks **)</li>
  <li> to make <big>text big</big> enclose it in hash characters ##</li>

  <li> you can get <small> smaller text </small> using "µµ" likewise</li>
  <li> a <tt>typewrite like font</tt> will be used if you enclose text in two equal == signs  </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Lists</h4>

  <ul>
  <li> start a line with an asterisk * to begin a list</li>
  <li> use # instead for numerated lists
    <ol>
    <li> you can create sublists</li>

    <li> subsequent list points should start with the same mix of * and #    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h4> HyperLinks</h4>

  <ul>

  <li> just enter a WikiWord inside your text to create a new hyper link</li>
  <li> enclose some words in [square brackets] to create a HyperLink inside the WikiWikiWeb which is not made up of a valid WikiWord</li>

  <li> any valid internet address (starting with http:/) like http://www.example.com/ inside the text will be made clickable automatically</li>
  <li> enclose a www address or a WikiLink inside square brackets and assign it a neat title using quotation marks or the | character
    <ul>
    <li> [title | http://example.com]</li>

    <li> [WikiWord "title"] or ["title for" WikiLink]    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> if you don't want a WikiWord or a http://www-address (or [anything] inside square brackets) to become a HyperLink then just prepend it with a exclamation mark or a tilde
    <ul>
    <li> !NoHyperLink, ~NoHyperLink</li>
    <li> ![no hyperlink], !http://nolink.org/    </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h4> Tables with |</h4>
| just enclose | things with the dash | character | <br />
| to build a | table structure  | <br />
| browsers usually | leave out the missing | cells | <br />


<p>
Please always put an empty line before and after a table, so it stands out from other text in its own paragraph.
</p>

<h4> Pictures</h4>

  <ul>

  <li> to include an image into a page enclose its absolute www-address in square brackets, like [http://www.example.com/pics/image.png] </li>
  <li> alternatively you could use the image uploading function.</li>
  </ul>
