<h1>Wiki types</h1>
<p>
There are three wiki types: Teacher, Groups, Student. In addition,
like any activity, the wiki has the Moodle group modes: &quot;No Groups&quot; &quot;Separate Groups&quot; and &quot;Visible Groups&quot;.

This leads to the following matrix of nine possibilities:
<table border="1" width="100%"><tbody>
  <tr>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="col"></th>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="col">No Groups</th>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="col">Separate Groups</th>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="col">Visible Groups</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="row">Teacher</th>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is only one wiki which only the teacher can edit. Students can view the contents.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wiki of their group only.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis for all groups.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="row">Groups</th>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is only one wiki. The teacher and all students can view and edit this wiki.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is one wiki per group. Students can view and edit the wiki of their own group only.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">There is one wiki per group. Students can change the wiki of their own group only. They can view the wikis for all groups.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th valign="top" width="25%" scope="row">Student</th>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">Every student has their own wiki which only they and their teacher can view and edit.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of other students in their group.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of all other students in the course.</td>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Unless the group mode has been forced by the course settings, it can be set with the groups icons on the course home page after the wiki has been created.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A teacher can always edit every wiki in the course</li>
</ul>
