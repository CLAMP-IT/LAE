<h1>Grading the Student Assessments</h1>

<p>This screen is used to enter the teacher's grade for the assessment made
    by the student during the submission and assessment phase of the assignment. A relatively
    simple grading is used, the score out of 20. The teacher can decide what is
    being graded and the relative scores from the instructions given to the students
    before the assignment started. For example, at a higher level the students may be
    required to give critical comments, at an intermediate level the students may be
    required to point out strengths and weaknesses, and at a lower level the students
    may be simply pointing out errors and inaccuracies.</p>

<p>If available the Teacher's own assessment is shown before that of the
    student so an easy comparison can be made. The teacher's own
    comments can act as a kind of benchmark.</p>

<p>The grade for the assessment is
    saved by clicking on the appropriate button at the foot of the page. There is a
    chance to repeat the grading within the &quot;editing&quot; period. Once that
    time has elapsed the teacher's comment is made available to the student. The
    &quot;grading grade&quot;, however, is not revealed to the student until the
    final grades are made available. (The reason for this is the likely confusion
    between the grade for the piece of work and the grade for the ASSESSMENT
    of that work, at an early stage of an assignment the distinction will not be
    clear to students.)</p>
