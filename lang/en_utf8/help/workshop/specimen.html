<h1>Specimen Assessment Form</h1>

<p>This page shows the details of the actual form used to grade
    your assignment. It will be used by the teacher to grade your work. Further,
    in a peer graded assignment, the same form will be used by yourself and
    your fellow students to grade the submitted pieces of work.</p>

<p>Please note that although you can change the grades on
    this form these changes are NOT saved. This is simply a specimen form,
    but a very similar form will be used by the teacher and possibly by you
    during this assignment.</p>
