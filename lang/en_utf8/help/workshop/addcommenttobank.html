<h1>Add Comment to Bank</h1>

<p>Frequently used comments can be added to the Assessment form so that there 
    is no need to re-type them each time they are required. These 
    &quot;stock&quot; comments appear below the Feedback/Comment box. Clicking 
    on the comment adds that text to the Feedback box. The steps to add a 
    comment to the Assessment form are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Type the comment in the Feedback/Comment Box;</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Add Comment to Bank&quot; button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Assessment form is redisplayed. The new comment is left in the 
    Feedback/Comment box and it also appears (as a link) below the 
    Feedback/Comment box. In future assessments the comment can be added by 
    simply clicking on the comment text. It is then added to the 
    Feedback/Comment box.</p>

<p>The stock comments are always added to the end of any existing text in the
    Feedback/Comment box and separated from that text by a space.</p>
