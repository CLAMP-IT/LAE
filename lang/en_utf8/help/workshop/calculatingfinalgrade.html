<h1>The Calculation of the Final Grade</h1>

<p>The table on this screen shows how the final grades for the students
    are calculated. The final grades are a weighted sum of up to five components.</p>

<ol>
<li>The teacher's grade for their submitted work. This is optional and will be
    used if the teacher actually assesses the student's work. If the student submits
    more than one piece of work the &quot;best&quot; grade is used. Here, best
    means the piece of work with the highest weighted combination of teacher's
    grade and peer grade...</li>
<li>The average of the peer grades for their submitted work. Again if the student
    submits more than one piece of work the &quot;best&quot; grade is used. The
    peer grade can optionally
    include the teacher's grade. This grade would be included if the number of
    peer gradings is very low or it is thought that the peer gradings are suspect
    either because of bias (usually on the high side) or for not being reliable.
    If included the teacher's grade is treated in the same way as a peer grade in
    the calculation of the average.</li>
<li>The student's bias in grading peer work. This is measure of whether the
    student grades work either too high or too low. It is not an absolute measure
    as it is based on the difference between the student's grade and the peer
    averages for each of the submissions they assessed. In general this component
    should NOT be given a high weighting.</li>
<li>The student's reliability in grading peer work. This is a measure on how well
    a students grades follow the peer average for the pieces of work they
    assessed. The measure discounts the student bias and averages the absolute
    differences between their grades and the peer average grades. In theory if
    the students gives high marks for good pieces of work and low marks for poor
    pieces of work their reliability will be high. If it is suspected that the students in
    general are poor assessors then the teacher's grades should be included into
    the peer averages, this should make the reliability values more meaningful.
<li>The average grade given by the teacher for the student's assessments.</li>
    This includes both the preliminary assessments made by the student on the
    example pieces of work and any grading the teacher makes on the assessments
    produced during the peer assessment phase of the assignment. In general this
    component is probably more important than both the Bias and Reliability
    components and thus, if available, should be weighted higher.</li>
</ol>

<p>These five components can be weighted as deemed appropriate for the
    assignment. For example the teacher's grade might be weighted strongly
    if the peer grading part of the assignment is only considered a minor part
    of the assignment as a whole. Alternatively, if the teacher only grades a few
    of the submissions these grades can be ignored by giving them a zero weighting.
    If the assignment is all about the students as judges and the providing of feedback
    then first two components may be set to zero (or low) and the students'
    grading abilities will determine the final grades.</p>

<p>Note that this screen is used iteratively and the final grades are not normally
    made available to the students until the final phase of the assignment. Once the
    the teacher is happy with the final grades and their weightings then they can
    be made available to the students.
