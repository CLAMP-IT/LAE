<h1>Grading of Peer Assignments</h1>

<p>For ease of grading a Peer Assignment is divided into a number of
    assessment &quot;elements&quot;. Each element covers
    a particular aspect of the assignment. Depending on the type of assessment,
    for each element you should
<ol>
<li>Enter a Grade by clicking in the appropriate button or selecting an appropriate
    number from the drop down menu.</li>

<li>Enter an explanation of why you gave that grade in the Feedback box. If
    you feel that the reason is obvious then leave the box empty. Note, however,
    that the teacher may look at your assessment and may well query a grade
    if there is no explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other type of assessments, you are asked to determine if various items
    are present or absent, in others you are asked to choose which statement best
    fits the piece of work. In both of these assignments you can adjust the grade
    somewhat as you see fit.</p>

<p>The last box on this form allows you to make a general comment on the
    work. This should justify your assessment. It should be polite and as far as
    possible constructive. Your assessment will be shown to the student who
    produced the piece of work.</p>

<p>You have a limited period of time, typically half an hour, in which to
    change your mind and alter your grades or comments. Once that period
    is over the person whose work you are assessing is notified about the assessment.
    At that stage you can view your assessment but you cannot change it.
