<h1>The Final Grades</h1>

<p>The table on this screen lists the final grades and their breakdown as shown to
    the students. If there are missing values in the table then it is possible to &quot;go back&quot;
    and add these. In fact, there are two adjustments which can be made to the Final Grades.

<ol>
<li>If a teacher's grade needs to be added then the piece of work can be
    graded by going
    to the teacher's Management screen for assignment and clicking on the link &quot;Student
    Submissions for Assessment&quot;. Any outstanding submissions can be graded. Once this has
    been done then move the assignment back to Phase 3 and re-calculate the Final grades. In a
    similar way any assessments which have not been graded can be graded from the Management
    screen.</li>
<li>If it is desired to use a different weighting scheme then the assignment should be moved
    back to Phase 3 and link    &quot;Calculate Final Grades&quot; can be clicked and the new
    weights entered. After the grades have been re-calculated the assignment should be moved
    to Phase 4 to make the new grades available.</li>
</ol>
