<h1>Release Teacher Grades</h1>

<p>This date can be used to withhold the assessments (and grades) made by the 
    teacher until the given date. By default the date is set to the workshop's 
    creation date and time. If the date is not changed then the teacher's 
    assessments are available to the students a short time after they are done 
    (the short time is typically half an hour, the &quot;maxeditingtime&quot;).
    Setting this option allows the teacher to withhold their own assessments 
    until later in the assignment. For example if the teacher wishes to 
    withhold their own assessments until the deadline date, then the Release 
    date is set to the same date as the deadline.
