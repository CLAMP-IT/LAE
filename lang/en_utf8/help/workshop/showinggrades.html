<h1>Hide Grades before Agreement</h1>

<p>This option can be used in a workshop assignment where there 
    must be agreement between the students on each assessment.
    The default value is to show the student whose work is being 
    assessed both the comments and the grades in the peer assessments. This
    may lead to more disputes than when the option is turned on and the 
    assessments are shown without the grades. </p>

<p>If the option is taken to hide grades in the peer assessments the
    grades are revealed once agreement has been reached. This agreement
    will, of course, have been made only on the comments. If these comments
    do not reasonably match the grades then the student whose work is being 
    assessed may well appeal to the teacher.
