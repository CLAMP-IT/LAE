<h1>Grading of Student Submissions</h1>

<p>In general, it is recommended that the teacher assesses a fair proportion of
    the work submitted by the students. The assessments are shown to the
    students and will provide important feedback on their work.</p>

<p>The assessments from the teacher are used in two ways in the workshop
    module. Firstly, they are used in the calculations to determine
    the &quot;grading grades&quot;, the grades given the student assessments.
    Secondly they are used in the calculation of the submission grades. These
    assessments can be given extra weight (the &quot;Weight of Teacher
    Assessments&quot; option), this weighting effects both the grading grade
    and the submission grade calculations. If it felt that the student
    assessments are too high (or too low), increasing this weighting factor
    should be considered as that will help stabilise the grades to a degree.
