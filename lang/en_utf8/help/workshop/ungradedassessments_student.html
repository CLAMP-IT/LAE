<h1>UnGraded Assessments (Student Submissions)</h1>

<p><b>Assessment of Student Submissions</b> These are the peer assessments
    made by students on each other's work. In general, these assessments do NOT
    have to be graded by the teacher. Provided each of the student submissions is
    assessed about five times, the system can make a reasonable judgement on
    the individual assessment performance of the students. When the number of
    peer assessments is low then the teacher may want to grade these
    assessments. Any grades given to the assessments can be taken into account
    when calculating the final grades for the students.</p>
