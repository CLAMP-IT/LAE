<h1>Submission of Teacher's Examples</h1>

<p>If the students are required to assess some example pieces of work
    before submitting their own work, the teacher uses this link to submit
    that work. The teacher can submit any number of pieces of work. If the
    number of pieces of work is greater than the number of example
    assessments each student must make, then the work is allocated in a
    random but balanced fashion. The system tries to assure that each of
    the examples is allocated to the students the same number of times.
    The allocation is random in that if, say, ten examples are submitted then
    it is highly unlikely that the first student is allocated submissions
    1, 2 and 3 to assess.</p>

<p>If the teacher submits a fewer number of examples than given
    in the corresponding parameter of the assignment, the students
    are given just those examples to assess.</p>

<p>After the teacher has submitted the examples it is important for the
    teacher to assess these examples. The assessments by the teacher are used
    internally when the students assess these examples. The closer the teacher
    and the student are the higher the &quot;grading grade&quot; awarded to the
    student. The assessments made by the teacher are private to the teacher,
    they are NOT show to the students at any stage during the assignment. The
    grades awarded to the students for these assessments are, however,
    displayed to the students. Once graded, the students are given an
    opportunity to re-assess the example if they to get a better grading grade.

<p>The examples and their assessments can be viewed and revised from the
    Administration page of the workshop.
