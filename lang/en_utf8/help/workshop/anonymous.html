<h1>Hide Names from Students</h1>

<p>A peer graded assignment can be graded anonymously. In this
    case the names (and any photos) of the students doing the grading 
    are not shown. Only the (file) names of the submissions are used to identify
    the pieces of work being graded. </p>

<p>When the peer graded assignment is not graded anonymously, the 
    pieces of work are shown with the names (and any photos) of the 
    students who submitted the work. This may lead to bias in the gradings.</p>

<p>Note that if the teacher's grades are shown to the students these are
    never shown anonymously.
