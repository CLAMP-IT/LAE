<h1>UnGraded Assessments</h1>

<p>In general, the assessments made by students are given a (small) proportion
    of marks which count towards their final grade. The grading of these 
    assessments (and those made by the teacher) is done in the background by 
    the workshop module. Provided a submission is assessed 
    three or more times, the module can make a reasonable estimate of each 
    assessment's &quot;worth&quot;. (For submissions which have been assessed 
    only once or twice, these assessments are given the maximum &quot;grading 
    grade&quot;.) As this grading process is done at regular intervals, the 
    number of ungraded assessments will normally be zero. (Note that in 
    Workshops where assessments have to be agreed, assessments which have not 
    been agreed are also likely to be ungraded. So in this type of workshop 
    the number of ungraded assessments is likely to be non-zero but the number
    should decrease as assessments are agreed.)</p>
    
<p>The function of this link is to force a re-calculation of the grading grades, 
    the grades given to assessments. The teacher may want to do this when either
    of these two options is changed:
<ol>
    <li>The option &quot;Comparison of Assessments&quot;;</li>
    <li>The weighting given to the teacher's assessments.</li> 
</ol>
    Clicking on this link will immediately bring the grading grades up-to-date,
    reflecting the current values given to these parameters. Changes to other 
    the settings of the workshop, such as the value for the grading grade 
    itself, do <b>not</b> require this re-calculation to be performed.</p>
