<h1>Peer Graded Assignment Type</h1>

<p>A peer graded assignment can have one of two types:

<ol>
<li>Only feedback on the assessment elements and the general comment
    is entered. The grading of assessment elements is not seen in the
    grading pages. Assignments themselves are not given an overall grade.
    However, the grading performance of the students is measured and
    this, and only this measure contributes towards the final grades given
    to the students.</li>

<li>Here the teacher and peers are asked to provide both feedback and
    grades. The assignments are given an overall quantitative grade as well
    as the qualitative data. The final grade for a student will be calculated
    from the (weighted) contributions of the teacher's grade, the mean
    peers' grade and the student's grading performance.</li>

</ol>
