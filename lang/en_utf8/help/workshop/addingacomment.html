<h1>Adding a Comment</h1>

<p>Comments can be added to an assessment to:

<ol>
<li>Add additional explanation or clarification to the assessment (by
    the student who assessed the piece of work);</li>
<li>Query the statements made in the assessment (by the student whose
    piece of work is being assessed;</li>
<li>Try to resolve difficulties which may have arisen during the discussion
    on the assessment (by the teacher);</li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of the comments is to try either reach agreement on the
    current assessment or persuade the assessor to revise their assessment.
    This discussion should be undertaken in a reasonable way. </p>

<p>If the work is reassessed then the old comments are discarded and
    are no longer shown with the new assessment.
