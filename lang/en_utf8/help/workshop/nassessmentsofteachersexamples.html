<h1>Number of Assessments of Teacher's Examples</h1>

<p>This number determines whether the students are asked to assess
    any example pieces of work before submitting their own work. If it is
    non-zero then each student must assess that number of example pieces 
    of work. They cannot submit their own work until these assessments
    have been made.
