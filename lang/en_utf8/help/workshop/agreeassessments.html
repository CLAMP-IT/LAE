<h1>Agreement of Assessments</h1>

<p>A workshop assignment can have either of these characteristics:

<ol>
<li>In the submission and assessment phase the students see the 
    assessments made by other students. There is no feedback 
    from the students who submitted the work to the students who made
    the assessment.  That is, there is only one way feedback between 
    peers on any one piece of work.</li>
    
<li>In the submission and assessment phase the students see the 
    assessments made by other students and they are allowed to comment 
    on these    assessments. They may agree or disagree with the (peer) assessment. 
    If they agree with the assessment then the assessment stands and is 
    used in the final calculations when determining the peer grade given to
    the particular piece of work. If, however, they do not agree with an 
    assessment the student who made the assessment is given an 
    opportunity to revise it. The revise/disagree loop can continue until
    either agreement is reached or the deadline is reached. An assessment
    which is still in &quot;dispute&quot; when the deadline is reached
    is not used in the final grades. This gives two way feedback
    between peers on each piece of work.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the second method of working is chosen there is the option of switching off the display
    of grades. That is, if this &quot;hide grades&quot; option is exercised, only the comments
    in the assessment are shown to the student who work is being assessed.
    The grades are shown only after agreement has been reached (on the 
    comments alone). Note that this option only effective when agreement on 
    assessments is required.
