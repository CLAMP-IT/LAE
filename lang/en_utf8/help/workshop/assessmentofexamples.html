<h1>Assessment of Teacher's Examples</h1>

<p>After the teacher has submitted the examples it is important that the 
    teacher assess these examples.</p>
    
<p>These assessments are private to the teacher, they are NOT shown 
    to the students at any stage during the assignment. However, they are, 
    used internally as reference assessments against which the student assessments
    are compared. The closer a student's assessment matches the teacher assessment 
    the higher is their &quot;Grading grade&quot;. The teacher has a degree of 
    control on how the agreement is translated into grades. This the 
    &quot;Comparison of Assessments&quot; option in the workshop. This option 
    can be changed at any time and the comparisons re-calculated.</p>
