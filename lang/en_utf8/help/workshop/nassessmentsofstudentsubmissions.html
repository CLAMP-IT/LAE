<h1>Number of Assessments of Student submissions</h1>

<p>This number determines whether the students are asked to peer assess    other
    students' work. If it is not zero then each student is offered that number
    of  pieces of work from other students. After assessment the originator of
    the work can view the comments and possibly the grade given by their peer. 
    (The peer assessment process may be iterative depending on the setting of
    &quot;Agree Assessments&quot; option.)
