<h1>Include Teacher's Grade</h1>

<p>This option allows the teacher's assessments of the submissions to be included
    as though they were peer assessments. If this option is set to YES then the teacher's
    assessments are in effect counted twice, firstly as the normal teacher's
    assessment and secondly by including them in the pool of peer assessments.
    The teacher might want to do this if (a) the number of peer assessments of
    each submission is low or (b) to try to stabilise the peer assessments when
    they appear to be either biased or unreliable.</p>
