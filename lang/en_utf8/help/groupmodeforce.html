<h1>Force Group Mode</h1>

<p>If the group mode is "forced" at a course-level, then 
   the course group mode is applied to every activity 
   in that course.  Individual group settings in each 
   activity are then ignored. </p>

<p>This is useful when, for example, one wants to set up a 
   course for a number of completely separate cohorts.</p>
