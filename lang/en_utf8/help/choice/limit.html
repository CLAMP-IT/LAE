<h1>Choice Limit</h1>

<p>This option allows you to limit the number of participants 
   that can select each particular option.</p>

<p>Once Limits have been enabled, each option can set a limit.  
   When the limit is reached then no-one else can select that option.  
   A limit of zero (0) means that no-one can select that choice.</p>

<p>If Limits are disabled then any number of participants can 
   select any of the options.</p>
