<h1>Display High Scores</h1>

<p>A list of the high scores for the lesson will be shown. Students who get a high
score can choose a custom name to list their score by. There is a 'badwords' filter
which checks for naughty names.</p>
<p>High scores do not display if the "Practice lesson" option is turned On.</p>
