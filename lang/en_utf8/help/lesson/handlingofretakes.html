<h1>Handling of Re-takes</h1>

<p>When students are allowed to re-take the lesson, this option allows the 
    teacher to show the grade for the lesson in, for example, the Grades page,
    as either the <b>mean</b>, this is average, of the grades over the first 
    and subsequent tries or as the grade from the students' <b>best</b> tries.</p>

<p>This option can be changed at any time.</p>
