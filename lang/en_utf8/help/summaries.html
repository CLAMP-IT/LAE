<h1>Topic/Week summaries</h1>



<p>The idea of a topic summary is a very short text to prepare students

   for the activities within this topic (or week).</p>



<p>Each summary should be very short so that the course page doesn't become too long.</p>



<p>If you find yourself wanting to say more than a sentence or two then 

   consider adding a resource to this topic instead (for example, the first activity

   might be a page called <b>About This Topic</b>).</p>
