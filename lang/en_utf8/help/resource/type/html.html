<h1>HTML page</h1>

<div class="indent">
<p>This sort of resource makes it easy to develop a complete single web page 
   within Moodle, especially when you are using Moodle's WYSIWYG HTML editor.</p>

<p>The page is stored in the database, not as a file, and you have a lot of 
   freedom to do almost anything you like using HTML, including Javascript.</p>
