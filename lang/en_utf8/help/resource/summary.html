<h1>Reading Summary</h1>

<p>The summary is a very short description of the resource.  You can 
   think of it as metadata.</p>

<p>For some resource display options, the summary is printed alongside 
   the resource itself, otherwise it appears on the resource index page
   making it easier for students searching for particular resources.</p>

<p>Do not be tempted to write too much here, or to include the 
   resource itself!</p>
