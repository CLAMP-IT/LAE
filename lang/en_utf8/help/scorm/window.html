<h1>Window settings</h1>

<p>These settings can be hidden/shown by clicking the button labeled Hide settings or Show settings.</p>

<p>Usually, packages are displayed in a normal window with the Moodle navigation
   controls on top and package TOC on the left side.  If you choose, you can get the content of the
   package in a new window.</p>

<p>However, if you wish to have your package appear in a new window follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the <b>Window:</b> section, select 'New Window'.</li>

  <li>Determine the size window you wish to open. <br />

<div class="indent">
  <p>Many people still use an average screen resolution of 800x600.  In most cases it's best if you
     initially size your window a little smaller than that, like 600 high and 480 wide.</p>

  <p>If you set 100% for both these fields then the new popup window will fill all the screen. 
     Percentual values will fill the percentuage of the screen set.</p>

  <p>If you leave these fields blank then the new popup window will be exactly the same size as the window they
     clicked on to get the popup.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
