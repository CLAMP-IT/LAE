   A package is a bundle of web content packaged in a way that follows
   the SCORM or the AICC standard for learning objects.

   These packages can include web pages, graphics, Javascript programs, 
   Flash presentations and anything else that works in web browsers.
   The Package module allows you to easily upload any standard SCORM or AICC
   package and make it part of your course.
