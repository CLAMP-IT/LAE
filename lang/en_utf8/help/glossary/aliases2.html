<h1>Keywords</h1>

<p>Each entry in the glossary can have an associated list of keywords (or aliases).</p>

<p><b>Enter each alias on a new line</b> (not separated by commas).</p>

<p>The aliased words and phrases can be used as alternative ways to refer to the entry.  
   For example, if you are using the glossary auto-linking filter then the aliases will be used 
   (as well as the main name of the entry) when deciding what words to link to this entry.</p>
