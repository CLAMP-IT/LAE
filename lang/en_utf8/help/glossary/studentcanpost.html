<h1>Students can post entries</h1>

<p>You can specify whether a student can or cannot add, edit or delete his/her own entries.
Entries exported to a main glossary can be updated or deleted by teachers only, so this setting 
only applies to secondary glossaries.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> A teacher can edit or delete any entry at any time.</p>
