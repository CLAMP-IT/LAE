<h1>Defining a global glossary</h1>

<p>Only administrators, and other users with the capability site:doanything allowed, can define a glossary to be global.</p>

<p>Any course may contain a global glossary (but particularly the front page).</p>

<p>The difference to a normal local glossary is that the entries are used to create automatic links throughout the whole site (and not just in the same course the glossary belongs to).</p>
