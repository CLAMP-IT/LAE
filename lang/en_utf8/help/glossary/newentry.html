<b>Last modified entry</b> will always display the entry that was last modified, 
and <b>Random entry</b> will choose a new one at random every time.  The option 
<b>Next entry</b> will cycle through the entries in order.  This last option is 
especially useful when a number of days is also chosen, allowing you to make a 
<i>Quote of the week</i> or a <i>Tip of the day</i> that everyone sees.
