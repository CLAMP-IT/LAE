ENGLISH
-------

English is the default language of Moodle, and this language 
pack is the "master" set against which other packs are compared.

If a string is missing for any reason from another language
then the English version will be used.

Each installed activity module in moodle/mod should have a file 
here, as well as the main file which is called "moodle.php".

The "help" directory contains whole pages written in HTML,
and the "docs" directory contains other miscellaneous 
documents.

If you are thinking of translating Moodle to another language,
please contact Martin Dougiamas!
