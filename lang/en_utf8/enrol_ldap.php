$string['description'] = '<p>You can use an LDAP server to control your enrolments.  
                          It is assumed your LDAP tree contains groups that map to 
                          the courses, and that each of thouse groups/courses will 
                          have membership entries to map to students.</p>
                          <p>It is assumed that courses are defined as groups in 
                          LDAP, with each group having multiple membership fields 
                          (<em>member</em> or <em>memberUid</em>) that contain a unique
                          identification of the user.</p>
                          <p>To use LDAP enrolment, your users <strong>must</strong> 
                          to have a valid  idnumber field. The LDAP groups must have 
                          that idnumber in the member fields for a user to be enrolled 
                          in the course.
                          This will usually work well if you are already using LDAP 
                          Authentication.</p>
                          <p>Enrolments will be updated when the user logs in. You
                           can also run a script to keep enrolments in synch. Look in 
                          <em>enrol/ldap/enrol_ldap_sync.php</em>.</p>
                          <p>This plugin can also be set to automatically create new 
                          courses when new groups appear in LDAP.</p>';
