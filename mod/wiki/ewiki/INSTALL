Information on how to install and use ErfurtWiki can be found in the
README, this file only contains notes for the impatient:

Quick Test Installation
=======================

- just move this newly extracted directory into your webservers docroot:
  mv ewiki-R1.00f7 /var/www/wiki

- then edit the "config.php" file, you may need to set the correct
  parameters to access your MySQL database server (db user name and
  password, and select a database different from "test")

- just go to http://localhost/wiki/
  (or whereever you did put the files)


Warning
=======

Simply installing these files unchanged onto a public webserver is a bad
idea, at least the tools/ subdir should be password-protected!
