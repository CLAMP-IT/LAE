ewiki/fragments/
================

This directory contains various (code) snippets, which may or may not
be useful for you. You are on your own, when it comes to make them
work.



mkhuge
¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Is a shell script to merge the core "ewiki.php" with some of the common
   extension plugins into a "huge-ewiki.php" script - for lazy people ;->



core.css
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Is an example (text/css) stylesheet, which shows how to tweak
   the look of rendered pages using CSS.

   You could copy it into yoursites.css or do something like this in
   yoursite.php:

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
     <STYLE TYPE="text/css"><!--
     <?php
            include("fragments/core.css");
     ?>
     //--></STYLE>



calendar.css
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   These stylesheet definitions show all possible CSS classes that
   are used within the calendar.php plugin. Use like core.css



binary.php
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   If yoursite.php is not designed carefully enough or EWIKI_SCRIPT_BINARY
   cannot be set correctly, you may want to use this wrapper script to
   allow for uploading and retrieval of binary content (images) via ewiki.

   Copy it to where the main ewiki.php script is, and set the
   EWIKI_SCRIPT_BINARY constant to the correct absolute position (possibly
   including http://server.name/) of "binary.php".
   (this constant must be set on top of ewiki.php)

   You must set the database access params in here, too.

   It may also be useful if you'd like to divide the database into its
   two parts again - text content and binary content. You could even
   let it save binary content in a flat file database, while WikiPages
   remain in a RDBMS.




homepage.src
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Is an __EXAMPLE__ on how to build a crippled Wiki (using authentication)
   for a private homepage.
   There is a lot of infos inside the script. And please remember all
   files labeled with "example" are just examples!!!!!!! (read: I'm rarely
   interested in bug reports)



funcs.inc
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Possibly useful pseudo-external helper functions are collected in here.

   function save_newest_pages()
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      Reads the recently updated pages list from the database (like
      "UpdatedPages") and tries to save it in another database table
      (this example does so in my privately used webcms for speed purposes).



htaccess
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Shows how to use mod_rewrite with ewiki.

   * old style:  http://www.example.com/wiki.php?page=WikiPage
   * PATH_INFO:  http://www.example.com/WikiPage

   Remember to enable EWIKI_USE_PATH_INFO inside ewiki.php - this was
   disabled once, because of the many broken Apache implementations (they
   seem to support that broken CGI/1.1 specification, which was for good
   reasons and luckily never blessed to become an official RFC).



strip_wonderful_slashes.php
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Fixes the very bad "magic_quotes_gpc" setting from php.ini for PHP
   versions prior to 4.3

   Does not hurt a well configured PHP interpreter setup.



wiki_format.inc
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Stripped version of the wiki rendering core for easier inclusion into
   your own projects.
