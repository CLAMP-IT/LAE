======================================
TO INSTALL OR UPDATE THE HOTPOT MODULE
======================================

   You should install only this module by installing a complete Moodle 1.9 package.

   Similarly, the recommended way to upgrade this module is to upgrade to a complete Moodle 1.8 package.

   However, it is possible to download and unzip a complete Moodle 1.9 package and extract the "mod/hotpot" folder for use on your live Moodle 1.8 site.

========================
TO USE THE HOTPOT MODULE
========================

1. If you haven't already done so, download and install the Hot Potatoes software from http://www.halfbakedsoftware.com onto your PC

2. Create any type of Hot Potatoes quiz on your PC using the Hot Potatoes software

3. Upload the quiz's source file (".jcl", ".jcw", ".jmt", ".jmx", ".jqz") or ".html" file from your PC to the "Files" area of a course on your Moodle site.

4. Also upload any graphics, sound files, stylesheets or javascripts that the quiz uses

5. On the main page for the Moodle course, confirm editing is turned on (click the "Turn editing on" button), then, in the section where you want to add the HotPot activity, select "Hot Potatoes Quiz" on the "Add an activity" drop-down menu .

   If "Hot Potatoes Quiz" does not appear on the "Add an activity" menu, you may need to enable the HotPot module as follows:

   a) from the site's front page select "Admin" then "Modules"
   b) click the "closed eye" icon for the "Hot Potatoes Quiz" module

   If there is no "Hot Potatoes Quiz" on the "Modules" page, you probably have not put the hotpot.php messages file in the right place. Please refer to step 2, "Install the messages and help files", of the installation procedure (see previous section)

6. The "Adding a new Hot Potatoes Quiz" page appears. Click the "Choose or Upload a file ..." button and select the desired Hot Potaotes quiz file.

7. Review the other settings for the quiz and click "Save Changes" when you are ready

8. You can view reports of the results via the "Hot Potatoes Quizzes" link on the "Activities menu". Students will see links to all the quizzes. Administrators and teachers will additionally see links to the statistical reports for each quiz.

9. You can also import the questions from the Hot Potatoes source file to the Moodle Quiz database, if you completed step 4, "enable import from Hot Potatoes XML files", of the installation procedure (see previous section)
